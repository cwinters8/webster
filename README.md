# Webster

ðŸš§ Work in progress ðŸš§

The root of this repo (i.e. the `github.com/cwinters8/webster` package
containing `content.go` and `content_test.go`) is the primary Webster package,
which could ostensibly be imported in other projects. The `server` directory contains
the runnable web server.

There are some incomplete notes about ideas, goals, and tasks in `notes.md`.

## Run

```sh
cd server
air
```

Then you can navigate to `localhost:8888` in your web browser.

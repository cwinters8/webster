# notes

Possibly use [GitHub's JS library](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.js) for content.

Would be better to run a server.

Host on Oracle Cloud [Container Instances](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/cloud-native/container-instances/) for free - each tenancy gets ~4 OCPUs and ~24 GB memory free every month for 'Ampere' (arm) compute

[GitHub module for Go](https://github.com/google/go-github)

## TODO

- [ ] [Custom skin](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/tinymce/latest/creating-a-skin/) for editor
